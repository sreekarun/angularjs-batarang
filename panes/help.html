<p>I have been dreaming about creating a tool to to show JavaScript entity relationship. The side effect that I was expecting was to be able to learn and implement D3 visualization library.</p>
<p>Have evaluated similar thought process in the past and was very impressed by Remy Sharp&#39;s work on jsconsole. Was about to get serious with it and just then I got involved with Angular and yes, Batarang!</p>
<p>Batarang has a fanstastic framework that a chrome developer toolbar can use. Batarang wraps D3, bootstrap, angular.. What else do you need.</p>
<p>The codebase of visual-debug is forked from and heavily influenced by the Batarang codebase and architecture. </p>
