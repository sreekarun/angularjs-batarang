# Visual Debug ( Work in progress / Screenshots and instructions to follow )

I have been dreaming about creating a tool to to show JavaScript entity relationship. The side effect that I was expecting was to be able to learn and implement D3 visualization library.

Have evaluated similar thought process in the past and was very impressed by Remy Sharp's work on jsconsole. Was about to get serious with it and just then I got involved with Angular and yes, Batarang!

Batarang has a fanstastic framework that a chrome developer toolbar can use. Batarang wraps D3, bootstrap, angular.. What else do you need.

The codebase of visual-debug is forked from and heavily influenced by the Batarang codebase and architecture.
